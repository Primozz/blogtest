## First test

Don't need to include level 1 heading with #, because the title already does that via post template.

### Let's see

Works fine.

### Syntax highlighting

There's also [syntax highlighting](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/liquid/tags/#linking-to-posts). [List of supported languages](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers).

{% highlight cpp %}
int main(int argc, char **argv){
    const char *first_arg{argv[1]};
    // do stuff
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
