## Trying how this works for a blog

Doing a bit of testing. Looking for something customizable. This seems doable.

So far so good. Managed to bring together a decent site, if I may say so.

Some stuff to do yet:

- Footer
- [DONE] Heading sizes h1 to h4
- [DONE] Meta tags
- [DONE] Re-generate webfonts https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator; got only Western characters; get Basic Latin, Puncutation, Latin 1 Supplement, Latin Extended A
